# Clock Angle

[Wiki source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_angle_problem)

Clock angle problems relate two different measurements: angles and time. The angle is typically measured in degrees from the mark of number 12 clockwise. The time is usually based on 12-hour clock.

A method to solve such problems is to consider the rate of change of the angle in degrees per minute. The hour hand of a normal 12-hour analogue clock turns 360° in 12 hours (720 minutes) or 0.5° per minute. The minute hand rotates through 360° in 60 minutes or 6° per minute.

where:

θ is the angle in degrees of the hand measured clockwise from the 12
H is the hour.
M is the minutes past the hour.
MΣ is the number of minutes since 12 o'clock. ![alt tag](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3e8da0d0c8c6bbe905beec87f243325054994ba9)

#Equation for the angle of the minute hand

The angle between the hands can be found using the following formula:

where

H is the hour
M is the minute

If the angle is greater than 180 degrees then subtract it from 360 degrees.
